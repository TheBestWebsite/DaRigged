# Hello!
This is a very small project to code a modified version of the game Nim in Rust. A computer will go against you. <br>
I currently have no plans to allow the computer to be beaten, but if you would like to implement that, please go ahead and create a fork - I have no plans to maintain this project after completing it.
# The rules
We start at zero. The computer goes first (so as to guarantee your loss). Each turn, the player may add 1, 3, or 4 (not 2!). You cannot go over 25. The first to reach 25 wins!
# Current limitations
As of the moment, if a non-number is entered, the code panics. Again, feel free to make a fork if you think you can improve this. <br>
### Now go forth! Impress your friends with this!
Just make sure to give me credit!
