# Hello!
This is a very small project to code a modified version of the game Nim in Rust. A computer will go against you. <br>
I currently have no plans to allow the computer to be beaten, but if you would like to implement that, please go ahead and create a fork - I have no plans to maintain this project after completing it.
# The rules
We start at zero. The computer goes first (so as to guarantee your loss). Each turn, the player may add 1, 3, or 4 (not 2!). You cannot go over 25. The first to reach 25 wins!
### Now go forth! Impress your friends with this!
Just make sure to give me credit!
# Notes
A slightly modified version of this game can be found on Scratch at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1151990314. Go there for more complete credits.

Thanks to TED-ED and Dan Finkel for the original inspiration for this project, "Can you solve the rogue AI riddle?" The lesson can be found on TED-ED's website at https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-rogue-ai-riddle-dan-finkel. (Note: the answer is also the answer to this game - I encourage you to try to solve the riddle before looking at the answer.)
